##### A simple list of movies (and sometimes TV) that nerds like me tend to enjoy

This is a (relatively) simple list of movies that "people like me" tend to enjoy.  The sole intent of this list is for me to remember movies I want to see or that have been recommended.  They tend to be sci-fi, but that's certainly not a requirement.  In most cases, obvious choices like "Star Wars" won't be included, w/the notable exception of The Matrices cuz I say so.  This list is no way intended to be complete, it's more for remembering or discovering less obvious choices.  Essentially this is a spreadsheet I used to have on google drive, but that I rarely updated.  I thought moving it here might make it easier to update and/or more likely to be updated.

I'll totally accept pull requests, but don't be surprised if I am slow to respond to them and/or reject them for arbitrary reasons.  A democracy this is not ;) however I am not, usually, an asshole, though I'm sure some people would disagree.  There is no "code of conduct" and all that, but let's keep it civil (for a definition of "civil" I will determine arbitrarily and not define anywhere ;)

|Title | Genre | Notes |

The Ghost & The Darkness | Horror
Searching for Bobby Fischer | Drama | One of my top 5
Cadence	| Drama | One of my top 5
The Martian | SciFi | New to my top 5.  Biased because I studied Aerospace Engineering (essentially)
Stargate | SciFi | The show is good too
Stargate Universe | SciFi | (TV) The best stargate show, still pissed SyFy cancelled this
